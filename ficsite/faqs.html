      <h1>FAQs</h1>
      <h2 class="leftalign">Who can do the hikes?</h2>
      <p class="leftalign">At Colorado Hiking Tours we offer 3 different difficulties of trips. These three levels are also broken down into different distances
      Since we offer a wide range of difficulties our trips are designed for anyone from families with little ones to experts in mind</p>
      <h2 class="leftalign">What gear do I need?</h2>
      <p class="leftalign">We recommend you have a good pair of hiking shoes built for rocky terrain.
      We also recommend that you have appropriate clothing depending of the weather and time of year.
      Your assigned guide will notify you one week in advance with a list of recommendations depending on predicted weather, time of year, and length of trip.
      If you are traveling there are plenty of local shops that have all the needed gear, as well as our own gift shop located at the main office.
      Keep in mind that all food and beverages will be provided the day of the trip but it is recommended that you bring a backpack for carrying for any trip over 5 miles.</p>
      <h2 class="leftalign">Do I need any experience?</h2>
      <p class="leftalign">For any of our beginner trips no experience is required, but for our experienced and advanced trips we do recommend you have done at least one beginner
      trip in the past. If you have any questions you can also contact our guides at <a class="navlinks" href="mailto:guides@coloradohikingtours">guides@coloradohikingtours.com</a></p>
